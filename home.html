        <h1>Message From 
            Secretary General</h1>

        <p>Greetings to delegates and world leaders alike,It is with great pleasure, as the Secretary-general, that I announce the eighth edition of Genesis MUN being curated by Genesis Global School and City One Initiative. Being recognized by United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan, the 2023 conference is bigger and better than ever.
            Our theme for Genesis MUN '23 is 'Diplomacy Reborn'. The past years have been filled with several challenges that have left an impact, not just on any one country, but on the international community at large. Economic and social vulnerability continue to plague the world. Be it, the war on Ukrainian frontiers or the one being fought by millions every day against poverty, inequality, hunger, and corruption.
            'Diplomacy Reborn' explores the world's growth throughout these past few years, and with it the growth and strengthening of international relations between all countries. Throughout times of hardships, borders have been redefined, new treaties have been signed, and yet the art of diplomacy remains as vital as ever. 
            And so, we invite delegates from everywhere to collaborate, negotiate, and debate to bring forward innovative solutions and new world strategies. Because when in life the world order gives you lemons, you debate and negotiate!
            <br>Devash Kaushik(Secretary General)</br>
