        <h1>ABOUT GALGOTIAS MUN</h1>
        <p>The Galgotias University MUN 2024 originates from the collaborative spirit and shared aspirations of a diverse cohort of students. It represents a distinctive initiative driven by the typical ethos of Galgotias students, serving as a response to the prevalent materialistic attitudes and disengagement from political affairs often observed among the youth. The design of our conferences is tailored to foster an exceptional learning atmosphere, aimed at challenging these prevailing tendencies and fostering a more profound comprehension of global dynamics. Galgotias University MUN 2024 endeavours to cultivate a platform where students can actively engage with global issues and enhance their understanding of international relations. We aspire to instil in participants a sense of empowerment and agency in effecting positive change. By providing a forum where diverse perspectives converge, we aim to nurture a generation of leaders equipped with the knowledge, empathy, and skills necessary to address the pressing issues facing our world. At Galgotias University MUN 2024, Through meaningful dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, we endeavour to create a lasting impact on both individual participants and the broader community.

        <h1>Message From 
            Secretary General</h1>

        <p>Greetings to delegates and world leaders alike,It is with great pleasure, as the Secretary-general, that I announce the eighth edition of Genesis MUN being curated by Genesis Global School and City One Initiative. Being recognized by United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan, the 2023 conference is bigger and better than ever.
            Our theme for Genesis MUN '23 is 'Diplomacy Reborn'. The past years have been filled with several challenges that have left an impact, not just on any one country, but on the international community at large. Economic and social vulnerability continue to plague the world. Be it, the war on Ukrainian frontiers or the one being fought by millions every day against poverty, inequality, hunger, and corruption.
            'Diplomacy Reborn' explores the world's growth throughout these past few years, and with it the growth and strengthening of international relations between all countries. Throughout times of hardships, borders have been redefined, new treaties have been signed, and yet the art of diplomacy remains as vital as ever. 
            And so, we invite delegates from everywhere to collaborate, negotiate, and debate to bring forward innovative solutions and new world strategies. Because when in life the world order gives you lemons, you debate and negotiate!
            <br>Devash Kaushik(Secretary General)</br>
